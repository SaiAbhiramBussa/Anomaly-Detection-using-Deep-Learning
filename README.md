Anomaly Detection System

This project implements an anomaly detection system for handwritten digits using a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## Features

- Upload and analyze handwritten digit images
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Visualization of reconstruction results
- Sample images for testing
- Error distribution analysis

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure you have the trained model file (`mnist_dae_model.h5`) in the project directory.

2. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

## Usage

1. Upload an image:
   - Click on "Choose an image..." to upload a handwritten digit image
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG

2. View results:
   - The application will display:
     - Original uploaded image
     - Reconstructed image
     - Reconstruction error
     - Anomaly status
     - Error distribution

3. Sample Images(Choose from testSet folder):
   - Use the provided sample images to test the system
   - These images demonstrate different types of anomalies

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `mnist_dae_model.h5`: Trained model file
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Note

Make sure you have the trained model file (`mnist_dae_model.h5`) in the project directory before running the application. This file is generated by training the Denoising Autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.
